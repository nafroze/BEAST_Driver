# BEAST_Driver
This Python script analyzes nighttime light (NTL) data to detect disturbances in human settlements, particularly in response to cyclone events, using the BEAST model. The script identifies disturbances, assesses recovery, and applies statistical methods (t-tests and Cohen's d) to confirm significance and effect size.
